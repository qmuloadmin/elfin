# ELFIN

A native Rust library to read, parse, edit and write ELF64 files.

## Notes

I'm writing this library to learn and practice Rust, and to learn more about ELF files. As such, it's probably not a good idea to use it any time soon, and certainly don't use it as an example of good Rust, if you are also learning Rust. There will likely be a million bad practices, and very little idiomatic code... especially in the beginning.

That being said, I would like for it to become a useful library, as I have a use in mind for it myself. So, if you have free time and feedback, feel free to tell me where I'm being an idiot.
